    "coaching_report": "**Summary Analysis**\n\nThe current professional summary is a good start, but it can be improved to better engage recruiters. The summary is a bit lengthy and could be more concise. Here's a suggested revision:\n\n\"Results-driven Machine Learning Engineer with 10+ years of experience in designing, developing, and deploying AI solutions. Skilled in building and deploying ML models using Python, PyTorch, and Hugging Face. Passionate about applying AI to real-world problems in healthcare, finance, and automation.\"\n\n**Skills Alignment**\n\nThe resume lists several skills that are present in the job description, including:\n\n* AI Expertise (LangChain, Streamlit)\n* NLP (Natural Language Processing)\n* Deployment & Operations (MLOps)\n* Cloud-native orchestration systems (Docker)\n* Python\n* SQL\n\nHowever, there are some critical skills missing, including:\n\n* Vertex AI or OpenAI\n* Prompt Engineering & Red Amber Green (RAG) skills\n* Gen-AI application programming interface (APIs)\n* Cloud-native presentation (GKE, Cloud Run)\n* Persistent layers (PostgreSQL, BQ)\n\nTo incorporate these missing skills, the candidate could consider taking courses or gaining experience in these areas.\n\n**Experience Analysis**\n\nThe bullet points in the experience section are a good start, but they could be improved to better quantify achievements. For example:\n\n* Instead of \"Led design and deployment of deep learning-based novel active noise cancellation technology,\" consider \"Designed and deployed a deep learning-based active noise cancellation system, resulting in a 50% reduction in cabin noise.\"\n* Instead of \"Developed real-time computer vision pipelines (object detection, segmentation) for autonomous vehicle sensor cleaning,\" consider \"Developed and deployed real-time computer vision pipelines, achieving a 95% detection accuracy rate and reducing inference latency by 40%.\"\n\nAction verbs and job-specific terminology could also be used to make the bullet points more impactful. For example:\n\n* \"Designed and deployed AI-powered predictive maintenance models using Python and Scikit-learn, resulting in a 25% reduction in equipment downtime.\"\n* \"Collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop and deploy a cloud-native AI application using Vertex AI and GKE, achieving a 30% increase in customer engagement.\"\n\n**Project Relevance**\n\nThe projects listed on the resume are relevant to the job description, but they could be improved to better highlight the skills and technologies used. For example:\n\n* Instead of \"Droplet Detection System \u2013 Embedded CV Application,\" consider \"Developed and deployed a real-time object detection and segmentation pipeline for windshield droplet classification using YOLOv5 and OpenCV, achieving a 95% detection accuracy rate and reducing inference latency by 40%.\"\n* Instead of \"Custom Decoder-only LLM \u2013 LLM from scratch with instruction Fine-tuning,\" consider \"Designed and developed a custom decoder-only LLM using Transformers and GPT-2, achieving a 25% improvement in language understanding and generation capabilities.\"\n\n**Format and ATS Optimization**\n\nThe current format is clean and easy to read, but it could be improved to make it more ATS-friendly. Here are some suggestions:\n\n* Use a single-column format to make it easier for ATS systems to parse.\n* Use clear and concise headings to separate sections.\n* Use bullet points to break up large blocks of text.\n* Use keywords from the job description to help the resume pass through ATS systems.\n\n**Recruiter's Perspective**\n\nThe current resume has some weaknesses, including:\n\n* Lack of specific examples and metrics to demonstrate achievements.\n* Limited use of action verbs and job-specific terminology.\n* Missing critical skills and technologies.\n\nHowever, the suggested changes could improve the resume's alignment with the job description and make it more engaging for recruiters.\n\n**Hiring Manager's View**\n\nFrom a hiring manager's perspective, the candidate's experience and skills are a good fit for the job description. However, the resume could be improved to better demonstrate achievements and impact. Here are some suggestions:\n\n* Use more specific examples and metrics to demonstrate achievements.\n* Emphasize transferable skills and experiences.\n* Highlight soft skills, such as collaboration and communication.\n\n**Scoring**\n\nBefore: 6/10\nAfter: 8.5/10\n\nThe suggested changes improve the resume's alignment with the job description, make it more engaging for recruiters, and demonstrate achievements and impact. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in terms of quantifying achievements and using more specific examples and metrics.",
